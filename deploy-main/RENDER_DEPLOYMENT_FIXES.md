# Render Deployment Compatibility Fixes

This document outlines the fixes applied to resolve compatibility issues when deploying the TradeAI Companion bot on Render.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Requirements.txt Compatibility

**Problems:**
- Version conflicts between dependencies
- Duplicate TA-Lib entries
- Very recent package versions causing build failures
- Missing CPU-specific PyTorch versions
- opencv-python causing build issues in headless environment

**Solutions:**
- Downgraded package versions to stable, well-tested versions
- Removed duplicate entries
- Added CPU-specific PyTorch versions with proper index URL
- Replaced `opencv-python` with `opencv-python-headless`
- Removed `pydantic_core` (automatically installed with pydantic)
- Removed problematic packages like `pdf2image` and `pytesseract`

### 2. Build Script Optimization

**Problems:**
- Attempting to install system packages without sudo
- Complex database initialization during build
- Qlib data download during build causing timeouts

**Solutions:**
- Removed system package installation attempts
- Simplified build process to focus on Python dependencies
- Added matplotlib configuration for headless environment
- Removed database and qlib initialization from build script

### 3. Render Configuration

**Problems:**
- Complex gunicorn configuration causing startup issues
- Incorrect port configuration
- Missing environment variables

**Solutions:**
- Simplified startup command to use `python main.py`
- Updated PORT environment variable to 10000 (Render default)
- Added essential environment variables for headless operation
- Removed Redis dependency from render.yaml

### 4. Main Application Updates

**Problems:**
- Hard-coded port 8080 not respecting PORT environment variable
- Missing root route for health checks

**Solutions:**
- Updated health server to use PORT environment variable
- Added root route ("/") for basic health check
- Improved error handling for deployment environment

## Deployment Instructions

### 1. Environment Variables

Set these environment variables in your Render dashboard:

```
TELEGRAM_API_TOKEN=your_telegram_bot_token
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
ALPACA_API_KEY=your_alpaca_key (optional)
ALPACA_API_SECRET=your_alpaca_secret (optional)
CHART_IMG_API_KEY=your_chart_api_key (optional)
DATABASE_URL=your_postgresql_connection_string
```

### 2. Service Configuration

**Build Command:**
```bash
pip install --upgrade pip && pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Start Command:**
```bash
python main.py
```

**Runtime:**
- Python 3.10.12

### 3. Database Setup

Create a PostgreSQL database in Render and connect it to your web service. The DATABASE_URL will be automatically provided.

### 4. Health Checks

The application provides these endpoints:
- `/` - Basic status check
- `/health` - Health check endpoint
- `/ready` - Readiness check endpoint
- `/metrics` - Application metrics

## Key Changes Made

### requirements.txt
- Downgraded all packages to stable versions compatible with Python 3.10.12
- Added CPU-specific PyTorch versions
- Replaced opencv-python with opencv-python-headless
- Removed duplicate and problematic packages

### build.sh
- Simplified to focus only on Python package installation
- Added matplotlib headless configuration
- Removed system package installation and complex initialization

### render.yaml
- Simplified configuration
- Updated port to 10000
- Added essential environment variables for headless operation
- Removed Redis dependency

### Procfile
- Changed from gunicorn to direct Python execution

### main.py
- Updated to respect PORT environment variable
- Added root route for basic health checks
- Improved deployment compatibility

## Testing Deployment

1. **Local Testing:**
   ```bash
   export PORT=8080
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Health Check:**
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:8080/health
   ```

3. **Verify Bot:**
   Check that the Telegram bot responds to commands

## Troubleshooting

### Build Failures
- Check that all environment variables are set
- Verify Python version is 3.10.12
- Check build logs for specific package installation errors

### Runtime Issues
- Verify DATABASE_URL is properly set
- Check that TELEGRAM_API_TOKEN is valid
- Monitor application logs for startup errors

### Performance Issues
- Monitor memory usage (Render starter plan has 512MB limit)
- Consider upgrading to standard plan if needed
- Check qlib data loading performance

## Notes

- The qlib_data folder is included in the repository but may need to be regenerated on first run
- Some advanced features may require additional configuration in production
- Monitor resource usage and upgrade Render plan if necessary
- Consider using external Redis service for caching if performance issues occur
